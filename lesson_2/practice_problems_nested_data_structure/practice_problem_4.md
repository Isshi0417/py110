# Practice Problem 4
## Problem
One of the most frequently used real-world string operations is that of "string substitution," where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

Given the object shown below, print the name, age, and gender of each family member:

```python
munsters = {
    'Herman':  {'age': 32,  'gender': 'male'},
    'Lily':    {'age': 30,  'gender': 'female'},
    'Grandpa': {'age': 402, 'gender': 'male'},
    'Eddie':   {'age': 10,  'gender': 'male'},
    'Marilyn': {'age': 23,  'gender': 'female'},
}
```

## Solution
```python
for name, info in munsters.items():
    print(f"{name} is a {info["age"]}-year-old {info["gender"]}.")
```
