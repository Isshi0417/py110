# PEDAC Guided Practice: Leftover Blocks

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

#### Leftover Blocks

*You have a number of building blocks that can be used to build a valid structure. There are certain rules about what determines a valid structure:*

- *The building blocks are cubes.*
- *The structure is built in layers.*
- *The top layer is a single block.*
- *A block in an upper layer must be supported by four blocks in a lower layer.*
- *A block in a a lower layer can support more than one block in an upper layer.*
- *You cannot leave gaps between blocks.*

*Write a program that, given the number of available blocks, calculates the number of blocks left over after building the tallest possible valid structure.*

#### Tasks

*You are provided with the problem description above. Your task for this step are:*

- *Make notes of your mental model for the problem, including:*
  - *inputs and outputs.*
  - *explicit and implicit rules.*

- *Write a list of clarifying questions for anything that isnâ€™t clear.*

#### Problem

**Input**: Integer representing the number of building blocks available

**Output**: Integer representing the number of left over building blocks after building the tallest possible structure



**Rules:**

- *Explicit:* 
  - Building blocks are cubes.
  - The structure is built in layers.
  - The top layer of the structure only has one block.
  - A block in the upper layer must be supported by four blocks in a lower layer.
  - A block in a lower layer can support more than one block in an upper layer.
  - There cannot be gaps between blocks.
- *Implicit:*
  - The number of blocks in a layer is its squared value.



**Questions:**

- Can the lower layer have more blocks than necessary?
